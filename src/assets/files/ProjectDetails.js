        title: `Dimension Reduction Analysis with Fruit-360 Dataset`,
        time: `April 2024 - May 2024`,
        summary: `In this project, I explored various dimensionality reduction techniques using the Fruit-360 dataset, which includes 90,380 images of fruits and vegetables. Using MATLAB, I transformed the 100x100 pixel images into 1D arrays and applied techniques such as PCA, kernel PCA (with Gaussian and polynomial kernels), t-SNE, and Autoencoder embedding. I plotted the first two features of each embedding to visualize how different techniques represent the same dataset. To evaluate which technique best preserved the original data, I employed the KNN algorithm and assessed overall and class-specific accuracy. PCA emerged as the most effective method, providing the fastest embedding (780ms) and the highest validation accuracy (0.99), demonstrating its efficiency in data representation and feature selection crucial for building effective ML models.`,

        title: `Sign Language Recognition and Translation`,
        time: `March 2024 - May 2024`,
        summary: `I developed a sign language recognition and translation platform to facilitate learning and communication in Indian Sign Language (ISL) and American Sign Language (ASL). The project involved acquiring, cleaning, and standardizing image data of sign language gestures. I explored various transfer learning models, including InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, ResNet101, and VGG16, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. A custom CNN, built with Keras, outperformed all other models with a 96% validation accuracy and efficient learning time. 
        For the web application, I used Flask and HTML to create two main features: gesture recognition, which translates gestures between languages, and translation, which fingerspells entered text in the selected sign language. The application was deployed online via ngrok to ensure global accessibility.`,

        title: `NBA Prediction Model`,
        time: `August 2023 - December 2023`,
        summary: `I developed a real-time NBA match prediction model using historical data from 1980 to the present, splitting the project into three key stages: extraction and preprocessing, feature engineering and model fitting, and building a front-end application. First, I used BeautifulSoup and the requests library to extract comprehensive data, including team stats, player stats, match outcomes, and advanced stats. After preprocessing and handling missing data, I loaded it into a MySQL database, with the script continuously pulling the latest data to ensure model accuracy.

        Next, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine which features best predicted match outcomes. By using Nate Silver's elo formula, I calculated team ratings and found that league win percentage, player efficiency, and elo were the most influential factors. I tested multiple machine learning models like KNN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, identifying the best fit for the data.

        Finally, I built a Flask-based web application. The homepage displays daily NBA matches, and users can click to view detailed stats, including team win percentages, top performers, and victory probabilities generated by our model.`,

        title: `Pokedex Website`,
        time: `May 2024`,
        summary: `I created an interactive website using React.js that showcases all the Pokémon. Each Pokémon is represented by a virtual card displaying its name and type on the front. When a user clicks on a card, it flips to reveal additional stats including Total, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. To enhance user experience, I incorporated an intuitive search bar at the top of the website. Users can easily search for any Pokémon, and the cards dynamically filter to display the best matches for the search query. This project represents my initiation into front-end development, combining creativity and functionality to bring the world of Pokémon to life on the web.`,
