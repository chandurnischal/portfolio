    //     summary: "I developed an algorithm to predict the likelihood of a person installing solar panels at their residence. To build this, I studied various factors that influence such decisions and consulted with industry experts for deeper insights. I conducted extensive exploratory data analysis to understand how these factors impact the final decision. By leveraging Bayesian inference and machine learning techniques, I created a score generation algorithm that provides insights into a person's likelihood of installing solar panels. Additionally, I built a rules-based score generation engine based on the expertise of industry professionals."

        summary: "I created user-friendly Python tools to extract and analyze location-based data, helping uncover hidden profit opportunities. By combining Python with QGIS, I was able to study and visually present client data alongside geo-spatial attributes, making complex information easy to understand. Through detailed statistical analysis, I estimated regional profitability, which has been incredibly useful for financial institutions, automobile companies, and real estate developers to make well-informed decisions."

        summary: "During my core electronics internship under Dr. Vishal Kesari, I delved into the workings of Radio Frequency (RF) windows and their crucial role in effective signal communication. I explored the bandwidth within which traditional RF windows operate and sought to enhance this bandwidth by making physical modifications to the incident surfaces of the windows. I proposed three different structures that significantly improved the bandwidths from 5.68% to 32.98%, 36.2%, and 45.06%. This research was published and presented at the Wireless Antenna & Microwave Symposium 2022 at NIT Rourkela, India."
