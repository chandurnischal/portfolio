        location: `Naperville, IL, USA`,
        role: `Data Science Graduate Intern`,
        summary: `I analyzed time series sensor data—temperature, pH, and conductivity—to validate AI models for cooling tower monitoring. Employing techniques like ARIMA and k-shape clustering, I identified critical operational patterns and anomalies. I crafted a robust validation dataset from historical data and company documentation, enhancing the precision of anomaly prediction. Additionally, I engineered a synthetic data generation algorithm that replicates real-world sensor behavior, empowering users to tailor anomaly characteristics for exhaustive testing of boundary conditions.`

        role: `Machine Learning Engineer`,
        summary: `I developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of solar panel installation by analyzing key demographic and structural variables, including age, income, roof area, and sunlight exposure. Through exploratory data analysis and expert consultations, I crafted a hybrid model that integrates a Bayesian decision model for demographic data with an optimized random forest classifier for structural features, yielding a consolidated probability score. This innovative approach optimized our targeted marketing strategy, allowing the company to pinpoint high-potential neighborhoods, enhance resource allocation, and significantly reduce man-hours.`

        location: `Bangalore, KA, India`,
        role: `Data Scientist`,
        summary: `I developed an advanced OCR data extraction tool using OpenCV, Pytesseract, and fuzzy string matching to extract, process demographic data from both English and non-English documents and organize it in a structured database for seamless future access. I built a geo-spatial visualization tool using Python and QGIS, empowering a non-banking financial company to pinpoint underperforming areas and uncover new market opportunities, ultimately enhancing loan approval rates and profitability. By applying this visualization tool to market analysis for an automobile company, I identified regions with significant competitor market share, delivering critical insights that boosted operational efficiency and profitability.`

        role: `Software Engineering Intern`,
        summary: `I developed robust OCR APIs using Tesseract to efficiently extract, process, and store data from public documents. By implementing a clustering algorithm, I identified regions in India with high purchasing power based on geo-spatial data, enabling targeted marketing strategies. Additionally, I utilized Python and QGIS for data visualization, providing clients with actionable insights to enhance their marketing efforts and optimize resource allocation.`

        location: `Bangalore, KA, India`,
        role: `Research Intern`,
        summary: `During my core electronics internship under Dr. Vishal Kesari, I delved into the workings of Radio Frequency (RF) windows and their crucial role in effective signal communication. I explored the bandwidth within which traditional RF windows operate and sought to enhance this bandwidth by making physical modifications to the incident surfaces of the windows. I proposed three different structures that significantly improved the bandwidths from 5.68% to 32.98%, 36.2%, and 45.06%. This research was published and presented at the Wireless Antenna & Microwave Symposium 2022 at NIT Rourkela, India.`
