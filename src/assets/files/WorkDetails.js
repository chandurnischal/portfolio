        summary: "I validated AI models for cooling tower monitoring systems by analyzing time series data from sensors measuring parameters like temperature and pH. I studied normal and anomalous data to evaluate model predictions and explored predictive techniques like ARIMAs and k-shape clustering. I built a validation dataset with known anomalies and developed an algorithm to generate synthetic sensor data, allowing users to customize anomaly duration, frequency, and length. This tool enabled extensive testing of various models."

        summary: "I tackled the challenge of predicting whether residents would install solar panels by analyzing a dataset with demographic and structural variables. I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand how features like age, income, roof area, and sunlight exposure influenced the decision. I then divided the problem into two parts: using a Bayesian decision model for demographic features and a random forest classifier for structural features. I combined the outputs of these models to estimate the likelihood of solar panel installation. This approach enabled the company to target marketing efforts more effectively, saving time and resources."

        summary: "I created user-friendly Python tools to extract and analyze location-based data, helping uncover hidden profit opportunities. By combining Python with QGIS, I was able to study and visually present client data alongside geo-spatial attributes, making complex information easy to understand. Through detailed statistical analysis, I estimated regional profitability, which has been incredibly useful for financial institutions, automobile companies, and real estate developers to make well-informed decisions."

        summary: "I developed an OCR data extraction tool using OpenCV and Pytesseract to extract demographic data from both English and non-English documents through fuzzy string matching. After processing and handling missing data, I structured it into a database for future use. Using this data along with geo-spatial information, I created a visualization tool with Python and QGIS. This tool helped a non-banking financial company analyze loan approval rates, identify poorly performing regions, and uncover market opportunities to increase profitability. Similarly, an automobile company used the tool to pinpoint areas where they lacked market share, understand competitive dynamics, and enhance their operations and profit."

        role: "Research Intern",
        summary: "During my core electronics internship under Dr. Vishal Kesari, I delved into the workings of Radio Frequency (RF) windows and their crucial role in effective signal communication. I explored the bandwidth within which traditional RF windows operate and sought to enhance this bandwidth by making physical modifications to the incident surfaces of the windows. I proposed three different structures that significantly improved the bandwidths from 5.68% to 32.98%, 36.2%, and 45.06%. This research was published and presented at the Wireless Antenna & Microwave Symposium 2022 at NIT Rourkela, India."
